# Sales-Analysis

The objective of this project was to get insight of the X company visually in PowerBI. The data was pulled from excel file. The concept of time intelligence was used. I also used cumulative measures and simple measures such as sumx, avgx, divide etc to get the basic insights such as total profit, profit margin, total transactions etc. Finally created a report and uploaded into powerBI server.
